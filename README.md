# AutismDetection
Using YOLO to detecting autism based on sMRI images and behaviors

we successfully addressed the urgent need to detect and diagnose autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using a comprehensive multimodal framework by integrating neuroimaging and behavioral analysis using advanced state-of-the-art deep learning techniques like YOLO, where we used these versions. 

YOLOv8 released in 2023 by Ultralytics, introduced new features and improvements for enhanced performance, flexibility, and efficiency, supporting a full range of vision AI tasks.

YOLOv9 introduces innovative methods like Programmable Gradient Information (PGI) and the Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN).

YOLOv10 created by researchers from Tsinghua University using the Ultralytics Python package, provides real-time object detection advancements by introducing an End-to-End head that eliminates Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) requirements.

YOLO11 ðŸš€ NEW: Ultralytics' latest YOLO models, deliver state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple tasks, including object detection, segmentation, pose estimation, tracking, and classification, leveraging capabilities across diverse AI applications and domains.
